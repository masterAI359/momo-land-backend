## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Socket.IO Service (`lib/socket.ts`)
```typescript
// Core messaging
sendMessage(roomId, message)
onNewMessage(callback)

// Typing indicators
sendTypingIndicator(roomId)
onTypingStart(callback)
onTypingStop(callback)

// Message reactions
sendReaction(roomId, messageId, emoji)
onReactionAdded(callback)

// System features
onSystemAnnouncement(callback)
onNotification(callback)
onUserCountUpdate(callback)

// Advanced features
shareLocation(roomId, location)
initiateCall(roomId, type)
joinDocumentEdit(documentId)
```

### Backend Event Handlers (`src/socket/handlers.js`)
```javascript
// Real-time event handling
socket.on('send-message', handleSendMessage)
socket.on('typing-start', handleTypingStart)
socket.on('typing-stop', handleTypingStop)
socket.on('add-reaction', handleAddReaction)
socket.on('system-announcement', handleSystemAnnouncement)
socket.on('share-location', handleShareLocation)
socket.on('initiate-call', handleInitiateCall)
```
